## Support Tickets Management - Metrics Building
### Scenario: 


You are working with our IT Support department which addresses any technical and non-technical queries raised by the employees within the organization. Every question, issue, or bug that comes into our support department gets logged as a ticket. Each ticket is assigned to a support person and will eventually be marked as completed once the issue is resolved.

The IT Support Team's manager John reaches out to you and says that he wants to build a metrics dashboard that will show the effectiveness and performance of the support team. How will you measure the effectiveness and the performance?

Think about the above scenario and list all possible Measures and KPIs that you believe will help measure the team's performancece. What data issues or challenges you would possibly face? Highlight all those issues, exceptional scenarios or outliers that you can possibly think of. Hint: Not all support tickets are the same.

# Possible Measures
I will measure the effectiveness and performance based on each team members resolved tasks and incidents for every month. This data is compared with the Team members of the other location. I will analyze the task and tickets resolved by each member by weekly and monthly basis.

Compare the results of the closed tasks and incidents of all the team members.

I would build a dashboard for example a bar chart that will illustrate Task Resolution, Task Submission, Task Details and Task Trends, Task Timing, Task closure, Asset Management.
